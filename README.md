# Disease Classifier based on symptoms
## Introduction

The repository would include machine learning models that have been trained on large datasets of patient records and medical information to accurately classify various diseases and conditions. These models would be based on a range of algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machines, among others.

The data sets included in the repository would be diverse and comprehensive, covering a wide range of diseases and conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and more. These data sets might include information on patients' demographic information, medical history, laboratory results, imaging data, and other relevant factors.

In addition to the machine learning models and data sets, the GitHub repository might also include sample code and scripts for processing and analyzing the data, as well as documentation and tutorials to help users get started with the tools and techniques involved in disease classification.
